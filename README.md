# HAMMING-NET
HAMMING NET IS USED TO COMPARE CLOSENESS OF TWO VECTORS,
Enter a row vector you want to compare with y1 and y2.
y1 and y2 are existing vector with which we will compare entered vector
so you can change y1 and y2,
you can more vector y3,y4 etc..,
In the hamming net output , you can see a=[3,1] so entered vector is closest to y1. because a(1) is maximum
